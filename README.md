# Rialize Progress!

## Overview
As a programmer, I want to know how many hours each day I worked on a particular project, but I don't want to have to punch a clock each time I start working (or stop the clock when I stop working). Moreover, I might forget to start the clock and stop the clock. Either way—I don't want to be bothered. Rialize helps me realize this goal by doing the monitoring for me! All I have to do is ensure Rialize is started (it will stop itself at the end of the day).

Rialize measures file-touches within a folder every 10 minutes across a day. Rialize assumes that 'file-touched' equals 'work done' within each quarter hour of time. When this 'touch data' is consolidated at the end of the day, Rialize will generate a report summarizing which hours had 'work done' on `files touched'.

Here is a sample Progress Report just generated by Rialize for the work I did on it yesterday.

## Quick Reference
Install Rialize with the 'rialize_setup.exe' (see this repo). This is a Windows-based application only.

Once installed, be sure to add Rialize to your %PATH%. You may now open your favorite command line DOS prompt, navigate to the folder you would like to monitor, create a .\db\ folder in that directory, and then launch Rialize with the following command line call:

   rialize --rtm --text .\

This will initialize Rialize, whereupon it will generate its first touch-file in the \db\ folder and then start waiting for each 10 minute segment. After each 10 minute pause, it will generate another touch-file. This will continue until midnight of the day you start Rialize.

    Let's say File-A is touched at 10:37 AM and again at 2:15 PM and then again at 2:17 PM — Rialize 
    will tell me that I've done 30 minutes of work on that "project" that day (the 2:15 and 2:17 only 
    count as a single 15 minutes of work).
    
    So even if I were staring at code for the four hours between those touches, we don't count that 
    as work because no updates were saved to disk during that time span.

The next day, you can run the following command line call and produce a Progress Report:

    rialize --report --text .\

This will produce a Progress_report_[stamp].txt file like the example above.
